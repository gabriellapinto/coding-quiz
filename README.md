## Description
This project's goal was to create a functional quiz made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This quiz includes 5 multiple choice questions that are timed. If the user selects an incorrect answer, the timer will decrease it's time. As well as this, the quiz tracks how many questions were answered correct and totals a score at the end. This project uses local storage as well for the highscores.
